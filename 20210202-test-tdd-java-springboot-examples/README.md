===========================================================

![alt text](screenshots/160523003036184.jpg)

Using Test-driven development to develop a new service on top of SpringBoot 'Hello' starter from https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/

---

## Result
Test-driven development is not about testing. Test-driven development is about development (and design), specifically improving the quality and design of code. The resulting unit tests are just an extremely useful by-product.

- Used @MockBean on Controller Test
- Used @Profile on Components Test
- Used DataDriven on Mapper Test
- Used @CsvSourve on Transformer Test
- Used Mockito.verify() on Repository Test

## Conclusion

Test-driven development is not about testing.
